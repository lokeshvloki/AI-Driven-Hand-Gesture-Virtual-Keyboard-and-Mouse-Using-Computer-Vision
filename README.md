# 🚀 AI-Driven Virtual Keyboard and Mouse Using Computer Vision

![Virtual Keyboard and Mouse](https://your-image-url.com)

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an **AI-powered Virtual Keyboard and Mouse** utilizing **Computer Vision and Machine Learning**, allowing users to interact with their system through **gesture-based controls** instead of conventional physical peripherals. By leveraging **advanced image processing** techniques, the system accurately detects hand movements and translates them into keyboard and mouse operations in real-time.
